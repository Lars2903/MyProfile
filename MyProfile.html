      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Personal Information</span>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>My background has been hospitality for many years. I am looking to change into the field of IT. I am 26 years old. I come from Dutch parents who have lived in Australia for 40 years now. I finished high school, although I wasn't ready to go on to study then. I do not have a background working or studying IT but have always been interested in IT.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Interest in IT</span></p>
      <p>I have had an interest in IT since a young age. Learning how to build computers and deal with any issues that arise with my father was something that I loved and want to continue, turning a passion into a career. The interest that revolves around IT is the ever changing nature of technology and the world. For me I have a strong interest in gaming and wanting to learn how to code games and push what can be done. I was looking at taking on studies since high school but lacked motivation to do it. I finally decided to take up a degree at RMIT to change careers and do what I want to do. After graduation I wish to pursue a career being a software developer. During my studies I wish to learn how to code (Java, C++, Python), what makes up the rest of IT. I am a beginner and novice when it comes to developing software and other areas that make up the wide world of IT.</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ideal Job</span></p>
      <p>Software Engineer</p>
      <p><a href="https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/job/637448/Software-Engineer-XBox-Live-SDK?jobsource=indeed&amp;utm_source=indeed&amp;utm_medium=indeed&amp;utm_campaign=indeed-feed">https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/job/637448/Software-Engineer-XBox-Live-SDK?jobsource=indeed&amp;utm_source=indeed&amp;utm_medium=indeed&amp;utm_campaign=indeed-feed</a></p>
      <p>This Job is appealing to me for many reasons. The role is with a well-known company that is built off software. Working with them would be an amazing opportunity and a great company to learn and grow. Skills required for this role would be years of experience in C++ and other coding languages. Experience coding across different platforms and understanding issues that arise.</p>
      <p>At this moment this job is not a role that I would be able to acquire. My skills are basics in Java and building computers.</p>
      <p>My plan to gain this kind of role would be to finish my studies and gain an entry level position being a junior software developer for a smaller company that I can learn and grow to gain the experience and skills needed to succeed. Learning C++, Python and java is a first step. Learning to turn code into a game either using unity or another program would be a great reference to develop my skills.<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OpAXD9XJHwmLZyfbMxg997X6kj_m9JbM5-15LnxlO7d_wEnxa536EEvfgllAwnxO2NxXJktMPruMfOVkXfnOfKTCBq0GxByzTi4RStpmrO7xCGs852OLImFJtJhrQ9mMlo3BSBxxDZcpmjFKaXQI00sf2WL6wCkwkFcKWYM6jscki5sDwUomEUxEe9YES-Gqc0NaWbOu457X_njCDnIGAlKUK7G99yclOVOWY2PUvOWucc72sXswfSdepAttHCLjM2RlaU4stf-eHcpoY09uUiLjOJsuHvE7BbnNjywFTjqv9Mki_pFU0PC-8s6JcUtzipSjaaJh2LMz9kGEDwtmJWkCxlizGmZI91yqNr-ZZZoR6fTbGOVfScNIgDL_Z6I-NlbshpkVtQIoLUqUw9kMWbLTpzUFVH8MIGUC1M2oOvFGMlFxiqUHs_heW-VXwPDgXrtNnXmWOsTdmSWOzGgUkdWoV46u6FD623oeTVvLVh39xTgtzL0m4FIkOwee-R6G1FNnDtTNKABcO-nV4q2OLINZqyDQetliG630NYxYWKxKziLKgFKkPb_alFJ0yd4gvGve7lyqeIetjFw6MwZr7N8G1HaBDCWeZZRslkNKDD-pxObMU7LtfWCGggutWgzwqhh3YgLzYCpT9Yd2LnhPC30wE-xNnz8=w1179-h937-no" alt="" width="626" height="498" /></p>

      <p style="text-align: center;">Learning Styles test: Tactile Learner</p>
      <p>My Score:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Auditory: 30%</li>
      <li>Visual: 25%</li>
      <li>Tactile: 45%</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You are a&nbsp;Tactile&nbsp;learner!</p>
      <h4>Tactile</h4>
      <p>If you are a tactile learner, you learn by touching and doing. You understand and remember things through physical movement. You are a "hands-on" learner who prefers to touch, move, build, or draw what you learn, and you tend to learn better when some type of physical activity is involved. You need to be active and take frequent breaks, you often speak with your hands and with gestures, and you may have difficulty sitting still.</p>
      <p>As a tactile learner, you like to take things apart and put things together, and you tend to find reasons to tinker or move around when you become bored. You may be very well coordinated and have good athletic ability. You can easily remember things that were done but may have difficulty remembering what you saw or heard in the process. You often communicate by touching, and you appreciate physically expressed forms of encouragement, such as a pat on the back.</p>
      <p>Here are some things those tactile learners like you can do to learn better:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Participate in activities that involve touching, building, moving, or drawing.</li>
      <li>Do lots of hands-on activities like completing art projects, taking walks, or acting out stories.</li>
      <li>It's&nbsp;OK&nbsp;to chew gum, walk around, or rock in a chair while reading or studying.</li>
      <li>Use flashcards and arrange them in groups to show relationships between ideas.</li>
      <li>Trace words with your finger to learn spelling (finger spelling).</li>
      <li>Take frequent breaks during reading or studying periods (frequent, but not long).</li>
      <li>It's&nbsp;OK&nbsp;to tap a pencil, shake your foot, or hold on to something while learning.</li>
      <li>Use a computer to reinforce learning through the sense of touch.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Remember that you learn best by&nbsp;doing, not just by reading, seeing, or hearing.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">Team roles test from <a href="http://www.123test.com">www.123test.com</a></p>
      <h2>Innovator</h2>
      <p>The innovator is often the creative generator of a team. He or she has a strong imagination and a desire to be original. The innovator prefers to be independent and tends to approach tasks in a scientific way. As a creative individual the innovator may play a crucial role in the way a team approaches tasks and solves problems.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>These tests show that I am a creative person who likes to be detailed and solve complex problems. I tend to day dream about impossible ideas. I learn from being hands on and doing things myself.&nbsp; I like to conceptualise and design ideas. I tend to be reserved when in large groups, while working in large groups might make me reclusive I am okay dealing with smaller groups. Smaller groups work best for me and given the opportunity to be creative that is where I would make the most impact. When forming a team I would need people who are able to build on ideas, ones who are willing to design a plan around the work to make sure that details aren&rsquo;t missed and in on time.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Ideas</span></p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;Overview</p>
      <p>In a distant world after the world has gone through an apocalyptic event. There is a civilisation that survived in space, there is a civilisation that survived on the ground and there is a civilisation that survived in a bunker. When a group fall from the sky and start to make their colony on the ground, all factions must find a way to survive together&hellip; or not.</p>
      <p>I have been a gamer for many years, what I have found though is that there are different gaming styles from RPG, action, adventure, simulator, strategy&hellip;etc; and I find there isn&rsquo;t a lot of games that combine a few different gaming styles to create a more immersive gaming experience. My project idea is a game that is a combination of different gaming styles united into a game that allows the gamers to play an RPG, action and adventure game, that is also a colony management game with strategic warfare elements.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">Motivation</p>
      <p>My motivation for wanting to make this game is because I am wanting to combine a passion for adventure games with a city management game. A few games in the past have tried their hand at this but the games are mainly an adventure game with a very small amount of simulation in it, for e.g. fall out 4. I switch between adventure RPG games and management games and often get bored after a while because of lack of content. I wish to make a game that changes and has multiple ways of playing.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">Description</p>
      <p>My game will consist of 3 or more faction that the player can choose from. Depending on the faction will change the game from starting location, supplies, people in your colony, abilities. The focus of the game will be being able to maintain your colony and relations with the other factions around the map. This will change depending on players actions while controlling their character (e.g. kill someone from another faction or destroy something), or when players make changes in their relations or policies that effect the other factions (e.g. starting weapons manufacturing, expanding land).</p>
      <p>The game would be both first person and third person, with the ability to change between them while in any area that you occupy or in a safe spot. This allows the player to change their surrounds and the colony at anytime to keep the management up, but also the ability to go into first person allows the player to control what they do, be apart of the action and not take a back seat.</p>
      <p>The game would allow for quests and adventures that allow the player in first person to increase or decrease their reputation and relations with different factions. These quests could be just a relation building or influence the reputation with another faction.</p>
      <p>The game would have a risk like aspect that you can take over land and increase your military strength of course you would need to be able to keep that land if you were to take it over. There will be a huge strategic element to the game where every action you make will have an everlasting impact.</p>
      <p>Players will get to create a character and design their strengths and weaknesses and depending on these you will have assigned roles within the colony. At any point in the game you can change players to take a character that has stronger abilities or professions that you would like to take advantage of. For instance a soldier would need to protect their colony, patrol the boarders and fight when taking over land. A scientist would need to research and explore crash sites and things that exist in the world that is new. A farmer or Gatherer would need to supply food for the colony.</p>
      <p>A survival element in the game would make it harder to survive and make the impact of decisions heavier to the overall feel of the game. Adding an initial survival element would allow even more diversity in what the game could offer. A beginning survival tutorial could help explore the world and different essentials that the game has.</p>
      <p>The challenges that would be faced while making this game would be size of the world and providing enough content to keep all player entertained. Creating a world where first person, third person and city management views can be seamlessly combined. Making each move that a player makes influence different aspects of the game would be the most challenging part. It would need an interactive ecosystem within the game.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">Tools and technologies</p>
      <p>I believe making this game would best fit the use of Unreal Engine 4 to design and create the game. Not only does UE4 support pre existing blueprints so that creating a new game can begin straight away, you also have the ability to use it to code your own game from nothing. A huge community is there for UE4, which is something that is a great resource when creating a game. EU4 allows the ability to develop games for individual consoles, within this it allows for a smooth transition for games to go cross platform.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">Skills required</p>
      <p>The skills that would be required to complete this project would be an advanced knowledge of C++ used for coding the game and debugging. Being able to design elements of the game would be an advantage, creating a custom game with custom designed features adds to the unique nature of the game. Map making and building creation within UE4 would prove to be a massive part as within the colony management view pre-set building and changes depending on area would be necessary.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">Outcome</p>
      <p>While there are many aspects of the game that could prove to have issues, from utilizing different game types and elements to creating a diverse ecosystem that changes depending on the player. But while there are a few things that would prove to become issues while in development. I believe that this is a type of game that hasn&rsquo;t been done yet and could prove to set a new standard for games that get developed thereafter.</p>
